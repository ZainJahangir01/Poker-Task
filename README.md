***Assignment-API***
Hi friends apart from the Configuration files the Project includes one ***src*** folder
which contains futher three more folders ***Controller*** and ***types*** and ***test***.
* Controller
It contains a decker.ts file which have all the methods and functionality of the API.
* types
It contains a card file which define the special type for ***Cards Name*** and ***types***.
types folder also contains a index.ts file which exports the card file.

* Index.ts
It is outside the source folder which starts the Server .

* test
It contains decker.spec.ts test script are defined in the package.json.
It includes testing for the methods of api with ***MOCHA*** and ***CHAI***.

* There is no Seperate ***Route folder*** for the routing you can find it 
in the last of decker.ts file using a seperate folder for routes is a better practice since i was new to the environment so apoligies
if you find any difficulty.

## use npm install or npm i to install all the node modules.
